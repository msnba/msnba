Hello! I'm a developer & high school student. I use Java and C++ for most CS-related things, as well as some web frameworks, and I am currently learning Rust. I prefer working mostly on low-level stuff and backend, but I also like working on random projects in my free time.  

DM **@msnba** on Discord for anything programming related.
