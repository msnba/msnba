Hello! I'm a developer & high school student. I use Java competitively and C++ for personal things, as well as some web frameworks for projects that require it. I am currently learning Rust to become a true 10x developer. I prefer working mostly on low-level stuff and backend, but I also like working on random projects in my free time.  

DM **@msnba** on Discord for anything programming related.
