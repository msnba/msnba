Hello! I'm a developer & high school student. I use Java and C++ for Computer Science, as well as some web frameworks, and I am currently learning Rust. I also like to work on random projects in my free time. 

DM **@msnba** on Discord for anything programming related.

I'm a bitch because I use Rust. By the way, I don't shower either.
