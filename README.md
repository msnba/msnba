Hello! I'm a developer & high school student. I use Java competitively and C++ (my beloved) for personal things, as well as some web frameworks for projects that require it. Otherwise, I prefer working mostly on low-level stuff and backend, and I am currently learning Rust to become the true 10x developer dragon warrior.

DM **@msnba** on Discord for anything programming related.
