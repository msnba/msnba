Hello! I'm a developer & high school student. I use Java and C++ for most CS-related things, as well as some web frameworks. I am currently learning Rust. I prefer working mostly on backend and low-level stuff, and I also like to work on random projects in my free time.  

DM **@msnba** on Discord for anything programming related.
